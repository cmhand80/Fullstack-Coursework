  <h1>This is a page to explain a little bit about me.</h1>
   <section>I decided to test the waters of coding due to a want to explore new career opportunities and to grow my skills.  Throughout my time thus far I have enjoyed learning, although the steps have been challenging.

     Outside of class/work I like to spend time playing intramural sports such as tennis and softball.  When these seasons are not going on, you can find me out hiking.

     If I am not outdoors I do love to read.  Mainly fantasy and history novels but I have been known to stray into other genres as well.
